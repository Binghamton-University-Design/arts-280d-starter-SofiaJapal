            <p> Sofia Japal is a student at Binghamton University who utilizes Psychology and Graphic Design to promote positive change within humanity. This past year, Sofia curated a showcase at the Binghamton University Art Museum titled "Black Angels and Black Angles" in which she highlighted the visual aspects of activism from Black women in the 1960s and 1970s. This celebration was inspired by the article <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/pajj_a_00490">"Where Are the Black Angels?"</a>, in which Kristin Moriah unpacked the history of the both literal and figurative white walls in art galleries, as well as eurocentrism in the notion of delicacy. Since then, Sofia has been inspired to redefine traditional spaces for art and make strides toward inclusivity in what society defines as ethereal. She hopes to use her newfound web design skillset to do so. <p>
